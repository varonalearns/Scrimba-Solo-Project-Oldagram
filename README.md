## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this solo project, I wanted to challenge myself a bit. I learned how to inject HTML to the DOM using JavaScript. This allowed me to parse a JSON object and insert elements into the HTML. Once I got over my fear, it was much easier to achieve than I thought. Just one line of code after setting up the elements I want to inject into the DOM.

``` js
cardsPosts.innerHTML = strPosts

```

I also learned how to create a counter of sorts either through a single click on the like button or through the post itself. I'm sure there is an easier way to do this but it worked for my purposes and with the knowledge I currently have:

``` js
const likeBtn = document.querySelectorAll(".like-btn")
const likeValue = document.querySelectorAll(".likes")
function addLikesByButton() {
    for(let i = 0; i < likeBtn.length; i++) {
        likeBtn[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
            let likeCount = parseInt(likeValue[i].querySelector(".value").textContent, 10)
            likeCount++
            likeValue[i].querySelector(".value").textContent = likeCount
        })
    }
}
addLikesByButton()

const post = document.querySelectorAll(".post-img")
function addLikesByDblCLick() {
    for(let i = 0; i < post.length; i++) {
        post[i].addEventListener('dblclick', function() {
            let likeCount = parseInt(likeValue[i].querySelector(".value").textContent, 10)
            likeCount++
            likeValue[i].querySelector(".value").textContent = likeCount
        })
    }
}
addLikesByDblCLick()

```

### Continued development

I am excited to continue to push my knowledge with JavaScript so I can add more features and make a project even more interactive. I am glad I decided to do some stretch goals. I want to continue to develop my JavaScript skills and make my code as efficient and effective as it can be. 

### Useful resources

- [Element.innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) - This helped me understand how to add HTML to the DOM using JavaScript.
- [Document.querySelector()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) - This helped me understand that I can grab more than just ids from the DOM.
- [Document.querySelectorAll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) - This helped me understand that I can grab a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors.
